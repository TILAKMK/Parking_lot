🚗 Parking Lot Management System (Stack – C)

A simple parking lot management system built in C using the Stack (LIFO) data structure.

It simulates a single-lane parking scenario where vehicles are parked and retrieved based on Last-In-First-Out logic.
The system also supports middle vehicle retrieval using a temporary stack, preserving the order of remaining vehicles.
